### 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project was built using fundamental front-end web technologies:

-   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the game page.

### 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this is a static website, there is no complex setup required.

1.  Make sure all three files (`connect4.html`, `connect4.css`, and `connect4.js`) are in the same folder.
2.  Simply open the **`connect4.html`** file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

### 🎮 How to Play

1.  The game starts with "Red" as the first player.
2.  Click on any column in the game board to drop your piece.
3.  Players take turns dropping their colored pieces.
4.  The first player to get four of their pieces in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game!
5.  The winner will be announced at the top of the page.
